# ros2-learning-journey
My personal journey learning ROS2 and micro-ROS through small practical mini-projects, notes, and examples.


In this repo I’ll talk about my ROS2 learning journey. I’ll add the source code, explain everything I did, the problems I found, and how I solved them.

For me, it’s always been hard to learn something by following a full course, watching YouTube videos, or reading long documentation. The best way I learn is simply by practicing.
So when I decided to learn ROS2, I read a little bit of the official ROS2 Jazzy documentation (documentation link), and I watched a video from a German YouTuber who made a simple ROS2 counter publisher just to get an idea of what I was going to do (video link).
After that, I looked for mini-projects. I already knew the concepts I needed to learn, so I gave ChatGPT the materials I had available and asked it to create mini projects that would help me learn ROS2 Jazzy + micro-ROS.

In this journey, I worked with an ESP32 (for micro-ROS) and Ubuntu 24.04 (ROS2 Jazzy).
